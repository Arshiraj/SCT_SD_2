This is a simple C++ console-based "Guess the Number" game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. It continues prompting the user until the correct number is guessed and displays the total number of attempts taken. The program uses basic concepts of random number generation, loops, and conditional statements, making it a great project for beginners to practice their C++ skills and understand interactive programming.
